<h1><u>
Overview</u></h1><br>
Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning. It can include activities like brisk walking,
swimming, running, or cycling. You probably know it as “cardio.”
By definition, aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.” Your breathing and heart rate will increase during aerobic
activities. Aerobic exercise helps keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy.
Aerobic exercise differs from anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercises, such as weightlifting or sprinting,
involve quick bursts of energy. They’re performed at maximum effort for a short time.
This is unlike aerobic exercises. You perform aerobic exercises for a sustained period of time.
Read on to learn more about aerobic exercises you can try at home and at the gym.
And remember, always talk to your doctor before beginning a new aerobic exercise routine.

<h1>At-home aerobic exercise</h1><br>
Cardiovascular exercises can be done at home. There are many you can do with little to no equipment, too. Always warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting any exercise.Jump rope
<p class="alignright"></p><b>Equipment:</b> gym shoes (sneakers), jump rope

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p >Jumping rope helps develop better body awareness, hand-foot coordination, and agility.

<p><b>Safety:</b></p> Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height. Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits. That’s the height you’re going for. If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope.

<p><b>Duration and frequency:</b></p> 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week

Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space. Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete.

<p><b>If you’re a beginner:</b>
</p>
Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet. Do this move for 15 seconds.
Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope. Do this move for 15 seconds.
Finish your set by doing a hopscotch jump for 15 seconds. To do this move, jump rope in place, and as you jump, alternate between jumping your feet out to the sides and then back to the center, similar to how you’d move them while doing jumping jacks.
Do this move for 15 seconds.
Rest for 15 seconds between sets.
Repeat 18 times.
If you’re an intermediate exerciser, you can perform the moves for 30 seconds and rest for 30 seconds between sets. The advanced circuit should be performed for 60 seconds at a time, followed by 60 seconds of rest.

<h1>Running or jogging</h1><br>

<p><b>Equipment:</b></p> running shoes

<p><b>Benefits:</b></p> Running is one of the most effective forms of aerobic exercise. It can improve heart health,
 burn fat and calories, and lift your mood, just to name a few.

<p><b>Safety concerns:</b></p> Choose well-lit, populated running routes. Let someone know where you’ll be.

<p><b>Duration and frequency:</b></p>20 to 30 minutes, 2 to 3 times per week

If you’re a beginner, run for 20 to 30 minutes twice a week. Your pace should be conversational during the run.
You can alternate between 5 minutes of running and 1 minute of walking to start. To stay injury-free,
 always stretch after your run.
